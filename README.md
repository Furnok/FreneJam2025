The 3 modifiers that i use are:
- Extreme Input Lag : The game has a permanent 1 second lag to handle the inputs. The game 
should still be playable though.
- Prefabs Only : EVERY GameObject on the scenes should be a Prefab, with no local override.
Those prefabs must be properly separated in terms of responsibility.
- Single Scene : make that game on only one scene and keep things organized on it.
