The 3 modifiers that i use are:
- Extreme Input Lag : The game has a permanent 1 second lag to handle the inputs. The game 
should still be playable though.
- Prefabs Only : EVERY GameObject on the scenes should be a Prefab, with no local override.
Those prefabs must be properly separated in terms of responsibility.
- Single Scene : make that game on only one scene and keep things organized on it.


Shadow Strike – Stealth Game with Input Lag

Core Concept:
- You play as a futuristic ninja or spy infiltrating a high-security facility. However, due to a cybernetic malfunction, all your movements and actions have a 1-second delay. You must anticipate guard movements, time your actions carefully, and use tools to outsmart enemies.

Core Mechanics:

1. Movement & Input Delay
- Every movement command (walking, jumping) happens 1 second after input.

2. Vision & Stealth
- Guards have vision cones, and you must predict their patrol routes.
- You can use cover or hide to remain unseen.

3. Gadgets & Tools
- Hacking Device – Remotely disable cameras and doors.
- Noise Generator – Throws sound to lure guards away.

4. Level Design
- One single scene (a large, multi-layered facility).

5. Enemies & AI
- Guards react dynamically to sound and sight.
